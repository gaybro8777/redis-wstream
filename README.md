# redis-wstream

redis-wstream is a node.js redis write stream which streams binary or utf8 data into a redis key using an existing redis client. Tested with mranney/node_redis client. (streams2)

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeffbski/redis-wstream.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jeffbski/redis-wstream)

## Installation

```bash
npm install redis-wstream
```

You will also need the `redis` client (`npm install redis`) or other compatible library. You an also optionally install `hiredis` along with `redis` for additional performance.

## Usage

Construct a write stream instance by passing in client and key to save stream to. Pipe to this instance and when end is emitted, the stream has been saved to redis.

```javascript
var redis = require('redis');
var redisWStream = require('redis-wstream'); // factory
var client = redis.createClient(); // create client using your options and auth
var d = domain.create();
d.on('error', function (err) {
  /* handle error */
  })
  .run(function () {
    readstream  // whatever read stream to read from
      .pipe(redisWStream(client, 'keyToSaveTo')) // create write stream instance saving to keyToSaveTo
      .on('end', function () {
        // readstream was successfully saved to redis key: keyToSaveTo
      });
  });
```

 - `redisWStream(client, saveKey, [options])` - construct a new write stream using redis `client`, saving to the key at `saveKey`. `options` can be used to provide additional stream options.

Tested with mranney/node_redis client, but should work with any client that implements:

 - `set(key, cb)`
 - `append(key, cb)`

Note: This module works by appending chunks to a key as the data is streamed in, so you will not want to use this key until it is finished uploading (`end` is called), you can do this in a variety of ways (keeping an active or status flag or loading to a temporary key, then renaming to the real key when done).

## Goals

 - Simple write stream which can use existing redis client (and especially mranney/node_redis)
 - Remove all the complexity of managing a stream and storing to a redis key
 - Pipe a stream into this write stream to save
 - uses streams2 from node 0.10+, but is also compatible with 0.8

## Why

mranney/node_redis does not have direct ability to take a stream and save it to a redis key, so rather than writing this logic again and again, wrap this up into a write stream so we simply pipe to it and it is stored.

Other redis stream implementations use their own direct network connections to redis, but I would prefer to use an existing connection for all my redis work which makes authentication and things lke failover easier to deal with.
